//Given an array A of positive integers of size N, where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :
//1. Each student gets one packet.
//2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students having packet with maximum chocolates and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.
